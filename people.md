Here is a list of the websites of some of the people in CPSSD.

If anyone or anything is missing, you can submit a pull request [on github](http://github.com/iandioch/cpssd.net). There's no need to link anyone who doesn't have the links to seal the deal.

If you have any questions about the course, you can probably find someone here to spam.

There is a partial Twitter list of CPSSD-related accounts [here](https://twitter.com/iandioch/lists/cpssd). Ping me and I'll add you.

There is a [CPSSD Github group](http://github.com/CPSSD) too, however many people are private on it.

You should also [follow all of our RSS feeds](http://feedlark.com)...
